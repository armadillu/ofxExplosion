# ofExplosion

Simple OF addon to draw configurable explosion animations.
ofExplosion Requires [ofxColorGradient](https://github.com/armadillu/ofxColorGradient) and the example uses [ofxMediaDB](https://github.com/armadillu/ofxMediaDB), but its not really required to use ofExplosion.

The example has commented code to tweak params locally ([ofxNativeGui](https://github.com/armadillu/ofxNativeGui)) or remotely ([ofxRemoteUI](https://github.com/armadillu/ofxRemoteUI)).
